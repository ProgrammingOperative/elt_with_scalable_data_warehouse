    "### AWS INFRUSTRACTURE AS CODE USING PYTHON FOR REDSHIFT DW\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is pretty simple to create and maintain few users and servers in the cloud using the provided UI but as they increase in number, it gets more cumbersome. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is where Infrustructure as Code (IaC) comes into play. IaC automates, maintains, deploy, replicate and share complex infrustructure as easily as one maintains code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In AWS, IaC can be made possible through the use of ```aws-cli SDK and Cloud Formation.``` \n",
    "\n",
    "AWS CloudFormation is a service that gives developers and businesses an easy way to create a collection of related AWS and third-party resources, and provision and manage them in an orderly and predictable fashion. It makes use of configuration files in json format providing a description of all resources, permissions, users etc\n",
    "\n",
    "For our case, weâ€™ll go the SDK way using Python to access and manage redshift and its resources. For this particular case we will create a configuration file that would provide all the necessary information to access and manage the redshift cluster already developed - ```redshift_cluster.config``` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This file would easen the programmatic access to the cluster while we write code. Information from this file are obtained from the \"properties\" window of the redshift cluster in AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating an IAM role would come handy in that, we would not need to explicitly provide the public and secret keys to facilitate communication between the aws services. We'll just use this Role.\n",
